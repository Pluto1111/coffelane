🌟 Project Context & Goal
This was a non-commercial pet project created to showcase robust full-stack development skills within a realistic e-commerce environment. The primary goal was to successfully simulate the real-life process of software development, team collaboration, and full system deployment, resulting in a fully functional online shop.

<br> ✨ Key Features
1. Comprehensive Full-Cycle Management
This platform is built for end-to-end functionality, demonstrating proficiency in handling both user-facing interactions and backend management.

Shopping Cart & Checkout: Standard e-commerce functionality for browsing products, managing a cart, and simulating the order process.

User Authentication & Security: Implementation of secure login, registration, and user session management, relying on JWT/OAuth2 for token-based authorization.

<br> 2. Dedicated Administration Panel
A critical feature of this project is the fully functional administration interface, which allows site operators to manage content, products, and users effectively. This demonstrates the ability to build and secure complex B2B (business-to-business) functionality for system operation.
